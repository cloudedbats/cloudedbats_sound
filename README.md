# CloudedBats - Sound

**Note: Software development for this library is not yet started.**

## sound4bats

The software library sound4bats will be used to extract and handle the sound parts that are produced by bats. The library dsp4bats takes care of the basic and more generic sound processing steps both in the time and the frequency domains. The goal is to separate pulses (shirps) from harmonics and noise to extract the more precise shape of each pulse. Sequences of pulses is also of interrest since that can be used for statistical analysis.

There are a lot of really powerful Python libraries for both sound and image processing that can be used.
